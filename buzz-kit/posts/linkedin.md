I just shipped social-preview-doctor, a CLI that emulates social crawler headers to debug OG/Twitter previews. It checks redirects, headers, and tags, and supports JSON output for CI.

Quickstart:
```bash
npx social-preview-doctor https://example.com
```

If you deal with social previews, I would love feedback.
