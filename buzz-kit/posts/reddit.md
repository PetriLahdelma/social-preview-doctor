Title: Show: social-preview-doctor — debug OG/Twitter previews with real crawler headers

Body:
I built social-preview-doctor to debug social previews the way crawlers see them. It checks headers, redirects, and OG/Twitter tags, and can output JSON for CI baselines.

Quickstart:
```bash
npx social-preview-doctor https://example.com
```

Feedback welcome, especially on edge cases.
